### Tips

If only simple calculations are required, in other words, if the "Total Tokens Needed" is already known, you can set the store item to have a Quantity of "1" and a Price equal to the "Total Tokens Needed". For example:

```json
{"shop":[{"quantity":1,"price":1000}],"currentTokens":250,"tokensPerMission":50,"staminaPerMission":20}
```

If you're familiar with JSON, directly editing the import / export content may be faster.
