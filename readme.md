## How to Use

1. Open [AP Calculator](https://undecv.github.io/APCalculator/).
2. Enter the values.
3. View the results.

> Hint: If only simple calculations are required, in other words, if the "Total Tokens Needed" is already known, you can set the store item to have a Quantity of "1" and a Price equal to the "Total Tokens Needed". For example: `{"shop":[{"quantity":1,"price":1000}],"currentTokens":250,"tokensPerMission":50,"staminaPerMission":20}`.
